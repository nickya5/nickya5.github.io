Hello! My name is Nicholas Andrews. I have always been faciniated with economic research across all sectors, and felt that adding to that research in important. So, I decided to start a blog! Much inspired by the old version of Nathan Silver's fivethirtyeight, this blog focuses on policy development and sports. I hope you enjoy going over the data collected and my own interpretation of said data.
