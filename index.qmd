I am a student at State University of New York at Geneseo. As an Economics major I am interested in research. My favorite research sectors are the economics of policy development and the economics of sports. Although these two sectors interest me the most, any research that may cause actual change interests me.
Outside of economics I am a college runner at the D3 level. I have seem great success through my ability to put forth a high amount of work ethic, time management, and communication skills with teammates.
